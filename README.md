# RestoDelivr

 I developed RestoDelivr, a dining app boasting a sleek and user-friendly UI. Offering both light and dark modes, the app integrates Firebase for Firestore database and email authentication. It presents a comprehensive menu with categories and add-ons, allowing restaurants to manage orders independently, outside of platforms like Zomato or Swiggy. Additionally, RestoDelivr generates instant digital receipts.
